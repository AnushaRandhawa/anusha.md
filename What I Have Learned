Github is a community platform where software sharing and collaboration with different developers is made possible thorugh use of different features and functions.
Users can write programs, edit them with convenience and work on them efficiently thorugh use of git and github.
I have learned some basic actions on github.
I look forward to learning how to use this platform in an advanced way to aid my course study as well as to hone my computing and programming skills.
